Dear Peter, <br>
i have just been doing some research on the Montréal tourism website, and i have found a great place for us to go and see when we travel to Québec in the summer holidays, can you tell me what you think about it? <br>
i can propose you a sculpture garden called "<i>Jardin de sculptures de Lachine</i>" that is opened everyday from 6am to 9pm, so it's perfect for early walks (or late walks if that's what you're into), and the best part is that it's free, meaning you won't have to pay everyday if your partner like this place when you go with them, anyway, here's their phone number <b><i>(+1)514-367-6423</i></b><br>
if you want, i have some other museum that you can visit, it's the museum of civilisation that is open from 10 to 5 on tueday to sunday, it does cost a <i>small bit</i> but not that much for a museum really, there are a lot of different expositions available, for example, an exhibition about peoples living in Québec before and now.<br>
i dunno if i convinced you, but i think that these avtivities could be really interesting for you.<br>
anyway, catch you soon, David.
